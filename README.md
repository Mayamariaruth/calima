## Planning

### Scope

### Database schema

### Color scheme
I adapted the colors on the site to my main image so it would look more cohesive.
I generated the colors from the image on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) 

I utilized the Contrast grid by Eightshapes to test my color combos so the colors complied with the highest accessibility.

### Typography
I used three different fonts across the page:

The fonts were sourced from Google Fonts.

## Deployment

To deploy the site to Heroku, I went through below steps: 
- Go to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) and log into your account.
- Click "Create new app" on the front page.
- Give your app a name (every name has to be unique on Heroku so it's ok if you can't name your project the same as on GitHub).
- Choose your region (USA or Europe) and click "Create app".
- You're then taken to the dashboard of your app where you have a navigation bar. Click on the Settings tab and scroll down to "Config Vars".
- Click "Reveal Config Vars" and input any necessary environment variables (such as your database URL or secret key).
- Go back to the navigation bar and select "Deploy".
- Scroll down to the "Connect to GitHub" section and click on the Connect button.
- After allowing Heroku access to GitHub, the "Connect to GitHub" section will allow you to search for the repository you wish to connect.
- Find your repository and click "Connect".
- You can now choose automatic deploys (Heroku deploys your app after every GitHub push you make) or manual deploys.
- After choosing a deployment method, click the deploy button and make sure you deploy from the correct branch.

### Cloning

I used the cloning method to use the VSCode desktop IDE with GitHub, below are the steps I took:
- Generate a repository and click the Code button in the middle of the screen.
- Go to Local and under Clone, copy the Git repository URL on the HTTPS tab.
- Go to the VSCode IDE front page and click 'Clone Git Repository' under Start or go to the Source Control button on the left-hand side menu bar and click 'Clone Repository'.
- Input the URL in the URL tab at the top of the window and press Enter.
- Select the location/folder where you want to store your repository on your computer through the popup and click the 'Select Repository location' button.
- VSCode will now clone the repository and you can choose to open it in your current window or in a new window.

## Credits 

### Installs

### Code 



### Content 

- The questions and answers were generated with ChatGPT.
- The social media links directly to the home pages of each site.
- Fonts were acquired from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Media

- The background image was generated with Microsoft Designer's AI tool.
- The color palette was generated with the image on [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
- [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) was used to generate the initial image of the ReadME to showcase how the site looks on different screens.

### General reference

- I relied upon my code learnings from the Code Institute, as well as the walk-through of the Love Maths project and [Codehal's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp8x8-reqZA&ab_channel=Codehal). There are similarities in some of the code but I credited the necessary sections.
- W3Schools and StackOverflow were the sites mostly used for external references.
